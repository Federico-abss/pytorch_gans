# Pytorch: From Zero to GANs
This repository documents my work done during the [Deep Learning course](https://jovian.ml/forum/c/pytorch-zero-to-gans/18) based on Pytorch and offered from Jovian.ml, the lessons were streamed on the Freecodecamp youtube channel, [my Jovian profile](https://jovian.ml/federico-abss) contains all the notebooks written during the course.

the course was composed of six lessons and 5 projects

### Module 1: PyTorch Basics - Tensors & Gradients 
* Introduction to Jupyter notebooks & Data Science in Python 
* Tensor operations and gradient computations 
* What is Linear Regression & Gradient Descent
* Linear Regression from scratch using Tensor operations 
* Weights, biases and the mean squared error loss function 
* Gradient descent and model training with PyTorch Autograd 
* Linear Regression using PyTorch built-ins (nn.Linear, nn.functional etc.)

### Module 2: Stocastic Linear Regression & Working With Pictures
* Converting images into Input that a ML Model can use
* Working with images from the MNIST dataset 
* Training and validation dataset creation 
* Softmax function and categorical cross entropy loss 
* Model training, evaluation and sample predictions 

[***Second Assignment: Creating a ML Model***](https://jovian.ml/federico-abss/02-insurance-linear-regression)  

### Module 3: Feedforward Neural Networks & GPUs
* Working with cloud GPU platforms like Kaggle & Colab 
* Creating a multilayer neural network using nn.Module 
* Activation function, non-linearity and universal approximation theorem 
* Moving datasets and models to the GPU for faster training 

[***Third Assignment: Creating a Multilayered Network***](https://jovian.ml/federico-abss/03-cifar10-feedforward/v/17)  

### Module 4: Image Classiﬁcation using Convolutional Neural Networks 

### Module 5: Data Augmentation, Regularization and Residual Networks 

### Module 6: Image Generation using Generative Adverserial Networks (GANs) 

### Final Project
Linear regression model built on the [WHO Life Expectancy dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who) to predict Life Expectancy.

# Pytorch: From Zero to GANs
This repository is based on the deep learning course based on Pytorch and offered from Jovian.ml, the lessons were streamed on the 
Freecodecamp youtube channel.

the course was composed of six lessons and 5 projects

### Module 1: PyTorch Basics - Tensors & Gradients 
* Introduction to Jupyter notebooks & Data Science in Python 
* Creating vectors, matrices & Tensors in PyTorch 
* Tensor operations and gradient computations 
* Interoperability of PyTorch with Numpy
* What is Linear Regression & Gradient Descent

[***First Assignment: Exploring Pytorch***](https://jovian.ml/federico-abss/01-tensor-operations)

### Module 2: Stocastic Linear Regression & Working With Pictures
* Converting images into Input that a ML Model can use
* Linear Regression from scratch using Tensor operations 
* Weights, biases and the mean squared error loss function 
* Gradient descent and model training with PyTorch Autograd 
* Linear Regression using PyTorch built-ins (nn.Linear, nn.functional etc.)

# Pytorch: From Zero to GANs
This repository documents my work done during the [Deep Learning course](https://jovian.ml/forum/c/pytorch-zero-to-gans/18) based on Pytorch and offered from Jovian.ml, the lessons were streamed on the Freecodecamp youtube channel, [my Jovian profile](https://jovian.ml/federico-abss) contains all the notebooks written during the course.

the course was composed of six lessons and 5 projects

### Module 1: PyTorch Basics - Tensors & Gradients 
* Introduction to Jupyter notebooks & Data Science in Python 
* Creating vectors, matrices & Tensors in PyTorch 
* Tensor operations and gradient computations 
* Interoperability of PyTorch with Numpy
* What is Linear Regression & Gradient Descent

### Module 2: Stocastic Linear Regression & Working With Pictures
* Converting images into Input that a ML Model can use
* Linear Regression from scratch using Tensor operations 
* Weights, biases and the mean squared error loss function 
* Gradient descent and model training with PyTorch Autograd 
* Linear Regression using PyTorch built-ins (nn.Linear, nn.functional etc.)
